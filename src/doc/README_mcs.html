<h3>What is MCS ?</h3>
</CENTER>
<hr>
The Maximum Common Substructure/Subgraph (MCS) is the most popopular 
concept for generating a one-to-one atom correspondence between two 
molecules.  A common substructure is defined as a substructure present 
in two molecules with the same atom types and bond connection. The MCS 
are defined as the common substructures with the largest number of atoms
 or bonds. Various types of MCS with different restraints have been 
proposed so far. Among them, we will explain Connected MCS and 
Topologically disconnected MCS, and the related concepts, isomorphic 
structure and substructure.

<ul>
<li><b>Isomorphic</b>: Each atom in a molecule must have a corresponding
 atom in another molecule. Atom types of all of the atoms and connection
 of all of the atom pairs are identical.

<p>
</p></li><li><b>Substructure</b>:Molecule A is a part of Molecule B. In 
the corresponding substructre, atom types and connection of of atom 
pairs are identical. Typically, the molecule A is assigned as the 'Query
 molecule'.

<p>
</p></li><li><b>C-MCS (Connected MCS)</b>: Maximum common substructure 
in Molecule A and Molecule B with the same atom types and bond 
connection. The substructure must be a connected graph, all the atoms 
belong to one connected component.

<p>
</p></li><li><b>TD-MCS(Topologically constrained disconnected MCS)</b>:Maximum
 substructure in Molecule A and Molecule B with the same atom types and 
bond connection.  The substructure can be a disconnected graph, however,
 the difference in the topological distance between corresponding atom 
pairs must be theta or less. The topological distance is defined as 
number of bonds on the shortest path between two atoms.
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>TD-MCS(theta=0): No difference in the topological distance between corresponding atom pairs.

<p>
</p></li><li>TD-MCS(theta=1): The difference in the topological distance between corresponding atom pairs must be 1 or 0.
